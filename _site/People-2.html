    <p>To learn something alone with the help of the internet, you have to know what you don’t know. But usually you don’t know what you don’t know.</p>

<p>Consequently, having supportive people in person is indispensable. I owe a big thank you to Nikhil and Cristian for that day I showed up to their DJ club. I had been poking around in Ableton Live for 3 months with (still) no idea how to mix — they told me I should use mixing (not production) software and taught me how to use a controller. 5 months later, Nikhil came out to my first DJ set in San Francisco. It was crazy to realize that if it weren’t for that day, I probably might have abandoned mixing because I didn’t know what to do next.
I also owe a big thank you to my manager, Jeff. He, out of the blue, without having ever heard me play before, knowing that I had never DJ’d live, took a leap of faith and included me in DOLOFEST and gave me a chance to play live. He could have easily said that I’m not experienced enough, or that I needed to have more tracks on Soundcloud, but he didn’t. The day he invited me to DJ I had the biggest smile on my face about getting my first gig.</p>

<p>In preparation, we went to sound check, where I learned how all the audio outputs worked, what it’s like to stand on stage, and most surprisingly, what it’s like to hear my own music on enormous speakers. He also spent an evening schooling me in DJing. He showed me that I could alter the BPM of a song without altering the pitch, how to move forward and backward in songs by measure, techniques of filtering out / cutting bass on transition, and how to use cue points to create flawless mixes. These had all been critical holes in my understanding of DJing. Sometimes, you have to see another person work to realize what you can do.</p>

<p>Lastly, sometimes you also have to ignore people. A lot of people will be really really supportive of you. But what’s harder to catch is the people who might not wholeheartedly support you. A powerful quote by Mark Twain comes to mind, one that is applicable whenever you are learning something new.</p>

<p>You’ve got this. Now get off the internet and start mixing.</p>
