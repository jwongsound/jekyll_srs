    <h2>Production Software</h2>

<p><strong>Ableton Live</strong> — used by Alison Wonderland, Kanye, and other mainstream artists. An entirely different approach to mixing which involves sampling a lot of tracks, also involves different hardware tools than normal mixing software uses. It is not exclusively production software — it is also intended for live performances, hence Ableton Live.</p>

<h2>Mixing Software</h2>

<p><strong>Traktor</strong> — An industry standard, one of the ‘giants’, majority of DJs use this, often sold along with hardware controllers so you can buy a controller bundled with software and save a bit of money. The controller you buy will be perfectly mapped to your software as well.</p>

<p><strong>Serato</strong> — The other industry standard, the other ‘giant’, a direct competitor to Traktor. People say that Serato has a better interface but Traktor has more features.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual DJ</strong> — Very similar to Serato, and has a nice feature which will automatically find you compatible songs by Key and BPM to make curating a bit easier.</p>

<p><strong>Mixxx (on Mac)</strong> — Free, open source mixing software. You can download it to see what kinds of features mixing software has.</p>

<p><strong>Djay Pro by Algoriddm</strong> — Has Spotify integration which is a massive plus — you can play around with literally any song you can favourite on Spotify (requires Spotify premium). It is perfect for someone who is learning since it means you do not have to put in the time to download all the music you might want to play up front. HOWEVER, you cannot record mixes while playing songs with Spotify, you have to download/buy your own music to actually do the recording.
I found that Spotify integration outweighed any other pros of software I could possibly consider. This may change, but as a beginner this was what I needed most. As a result I use Djay Pro. It has beautiful, seamless integration for Mac, has abstractified most complexities (but allows you to introduce them once you’re ready) and also doesn’t tie you to specific controllers.</p>
