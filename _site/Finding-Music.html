    <p>As I mentioned earlier, one of the major reasons I chose to use Djay was because of its Spotify integration. Djay also has a feature that helps you find songs that may blend with what you are playing:</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2098/1*rPfH4GSr6oSgfKQ7UkY1Wg.png" /></p>

<p>However, so far it currently only matches by BPM (not keys — which I would personally find more useful). It also doesn’t let you play off Spotify when you’re offline, nor record with it.</p>

<p>When I started DJing, I started listening to everything I could possibly find in Spotify, including a wide variety of genres — I found that mixing genres created an extremely lively dance floor and gives it depth. Then, after trying out blending them, I would go and download them from iTunes. Yes, on iTunes. Who still buys music anymore? DJs. DJs do. It’s because now you’re a musical artist and care about the people who make the music that you love to groove to, but also because you want the highest quality tracks.</p>

<p>However, you will be surprised by how much music you can find on Soundcloud — a lot of artists give you the option to download a song for free/in exchange for following them on Soundcloud. If you find yourself using a software like Traktor, you can download the sounds in a low bitrate locally and experiment with it before downloading the high quality song at a later point.</p>
