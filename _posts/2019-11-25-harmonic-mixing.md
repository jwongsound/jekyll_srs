Harmonic mixing is the idea that certain song keys sound better (‘harmonic’) together than others. A key tool to guide you in this process is the Circle of Fifths. At a most basic level, adjacent keys work well together.

I cannot do any more justice to this topic than this (incredibly amazing) resource by MixedinKey — this is where I’ve learned everything to do with harmonic mixing.

However, I will point your attention to the fact that if you sort by “Key” in Djay Pro, songs are grouped by key and adjacent keys are also adjacent in the circle of fifths. So, all songs in C-major will appear next to a group of all songs in G-major.

Knowing this, given a song in any key, you have 2 keys you can transition to (in the most basic case, in reality, as the Harmonic Mixing guide will outline, there are many many harmonic mixing rules). In either of these keys, you can pick out a song with similar BPM. This is likely a good candidate for a song that will mix well into what you are playing.

At this point it becomes important to note that Djay Pro does not distinguish between major and minor keys out of the box. It took me a very very long time to discover this (it took me three months, in fact, at which point I saw this functionality on my boss’s laptop — a week before my first live set). In order to see all songs broken into major and minor keys, in Djay Pro, go to Preferences > Media Library > Key > Distinguish Major / Minor Keys.
