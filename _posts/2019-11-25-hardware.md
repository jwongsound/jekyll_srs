WOW, we’ve gotten so far and the only investment we’ve made has been some software. While you could (and should) definitely use a hardware controller for better mixing control, I would recommend only getting one at the point where you have learned the functionality of many features on screen. I personally did not buy my hardware controller until I tried to physically reach into my computer to adjust the nob of the song I was playing. I can’t undermine the power of hardware controllers; the difference they make is colossal. But if you’re a poor student like me, you generally want to put off investing in things you may or may not need and in hobbies that may or may not take off. That said, now that we’ve made it this far, you’re obviously interested and I’m obviously here to help.

Unless you are long-term stationary (I was not — I’m moving every 4 months), you will want to look for a light controller with an audio card. No audio card means that your hardware controller needs to be connected to an amplifier. This is fantastic for audio quality and as a general idea, but was simply impractical for me. It would mean that I would have to buy (and move with) an amplifier and speakers. I also really cared about the portability of my controller because I would need to put it into my suitcase every four months, and this suitcase has a max weight of 50lbs. I could not afford a 12lb controller to steal this weight and and space when I am already moving my whole life from one country to another.
The Numark Mixtrack Pro 3 hardware controller (with built in sound card) was by FAR the best (entry level) controller I found. Coming in at 4lbs with metal jog wheels, all the EQ, filter, loop and cue functionalities, this was everything a beginner could dream of. The most important part was that Djay Pro had MIDI mapping for this controller out of the box. This meant that (almost) all the features I had in my software would seamlessly work on my hardware controller. Not all hardware and software is seamlessly compatible, so it is important to check the software’s documentation or search in its online community.

Overall, Amazon was an indispensable resource in the process. It included specification breakdowns, comparisons and related products that I may not have otherwise considered. Details about inputs, outputs, weight, size extremely useful at this point. Djay has a list of 50 natively supported hardware controllers on their site which can help get you started when you don’t know what to search for. Keep in mind that a lot of hardware you buy can come bundled with a trial of software it is compatible with, or sometimes the full version. The Numark controller was bundled with a trial of Serato, though I only ever used it with Djay.

When buying a controller, keep in mind that you may need a set of speakers at home to play around with pre-cueing / master output. Pre-cueing is used to listen to what you are about to play for the audience, while master is what everyone hears. Most DJ controllers have an RCA output which may not be the output you have for your portable speaker (but is standard output for DJ venues). To work around this, I bought myself an RCA-AUX adapter and a small portable speaker to listen to master output. However, I later realized that Djay could use built-in output (my laptop’s speakers) as the master output, even with the controller connected. Had I known this beforehand, I probably wouldn’t have bought the external speaker and RCA cable (given my semi-nomadic situation). If you have a more permanent set up, I would definitely recommend investing in a good set of speakers to hear your craft.
