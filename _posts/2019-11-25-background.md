When I first started mixing, I googled “How to DJ” where I was welcomed with a disappointing handful of guides. They used terms I had never heard of, explained techniques, skills I didn’t know I needed and seemed to be targeted at someone who already had some foundation. It lead me to consider doing an audio engineering course on Coursera (which is totally not necessary at this stage) while reading How-To Wikis. Frankly, I was all over the place. Coming out of the tech space where (almost) everything is meticulously documented, this was a surprise to me.
I’m writing this not because I know everything there is to know about mixing. Instead, I am writing this in dire urgency because I’m finally starting to understand something about mixing music. In order to write a useful beginner how-to piece, one has to remember every little thing they did not know when they were starting out. So, logically, only a beginner can write a beginner piece with enough empathy to cover everything in agonizing detail. Here I will walk you through the things I have learned (read: stumbled across by luck and overwhelmingly battled through trial and error) between the first day of deciding I wanted to DJ to playing my first gig at The Royale in San Francisco with hundreds of people, 8 months later.

While we’re going into agonizing detail, it is worth explaining what DJing and mixing music actually entails. 

DJing is taking a collection of songs that fit together by a number of qualities and finding a way to mix them together at key moments to keep people dancing on the dance floor, while augmenting songs’ enchanting qualities. My mom likes to call it ‘compiling’.
