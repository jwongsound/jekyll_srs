In order to mix two songs, the first step is to match the two BPMs of the songs.

When selecting two songs to mix, it is ideal if they are ~5 BPM from each other. So, if I am mixing a song at 120 BPM, I would select a song to mix which has 115 — 125 BPM. You can go as much as +/- 10% of a song’s BPM before it starts to sound funny (but maybe that’s what you’re going for, and that’s cool) (but make sure you give it a listen first). Once you’ve selected your song, you’ll want to make the two BPMs of the song equal, one way or another. If I have a song with 120 BPM playing and a song of 118 BPM I want to play next, I will usually bring up the 118 BPM song -> 120 BPM before it starts to play. Then I will make sure that both songs have a “1” beat at the same time, before bringing the second song’s volume up (more on this later).

<em>Side note: most songs you encounter will be in 4/4 time. This is the most common time signature, but it is not the only one. You will also encounter songs in 3/4, 6/8 time (Waltz time, Spotify playlist) as well as others. If you choose to mix two songs, they should be in the same time signature. Mixing songs of different time signatures requires advanced techniques.</em>

What I’ve described above is essentially how the ‘sync’ button works on your controller/in your software. Surprise, surprise — it syncs the two tracks. When you do this by hand, this is usually called ‘beat matching’. While the sync button is great to get you started with mixing and playing around quickly, learning to beat match is invaluable in your education process. 

Beat matching manually causes you to rely on your ear. You are forced to truly listen to what it is that you’re doing, rather than allowing technology to fill the gaps. Your ear begins to zero in on auditory cues, such as a distinct snare or hi-hat. You start to notice how the percussion is structured… the syncopation and groove of the rhythm. This, in turn, helps aid you with things like switching up genres and subtle mixing.

Tech is good, but it is not perfect. It will have mistakes in beat gridding (aligning a song’s key beats to a grid, which you see on your mixing software) and can fall out of sync. The importance of this knowledge can’t be overlooked, though admittedly it is overwhelming to master right from the start.


Note that in most software, altering the BPM will by default also alter the pitch of the song — you don’t want this to happen so that you can accurately keep track of the song’s key. Most mixing software will allow you to disable pitch-bending on BPM change. In Djay Pro, this is done by clicking on the musical note next to the tempo slider.
