As I mentioned earlier, one of the major reasons I chose to use Djay was because of its Spotify integration. Djay also has a feature that helps you find songs that may blend with what you are playing:

However, so far it currently only matches by BPM (not keys — which I would personally find more useful). It also doesn’t let you play off Spotify when you’re offline, nor record with it.

When I started DJing, I started listening to everything I could possibly find in Spotify, including a wide variety of genres — I found that mixing genres created an extremely lively dance floor and gives it depth. Then, after trying out blending them, I would go and download them from iTunes. Yes, on iTunes. Who still buys music anymore? DJs. DJs do. It’s because now you’re a musical artist and care about the people who make the music that you love to groove to, but also because you want the highest quality tracks.

However, you will be surprised by how much music you can find on Soundcloud — a lot of artists give you the option to download a song for free/in exchange for following them on Soundcloud. If you find yourself using a software like Traktor, you can download the sounds in a low bitrate locally and experiment with it before downloading the high quality song at a later point.
